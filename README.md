guitar neck (background) to draw notes and lines over >> Canvas-JS

Use dropdown to choose colour given to each semi-tone

Use color-button to either draw notes in these colours or a single colour of your choice

Use redraw-button to redraw all notes using the colour currently chosen, the original colours given to each semi-tone, or whatever colour the notes had when they were first clicked.

This way, and for the purposes of shape-excersices and such, you are not restricted to a colourful-only guitar neck, but can easily draw different patterns in the same colour, regardless of the notes in it, and change this colour to draw the next pattern.


(note that not all semi-tone colours have been setup in the JS file yet (or are available in the dropdown), so the colour will remain as the latest semi-tone you clicked which did have a colour assigned to, if clicking on an unasigned semi-tone)
