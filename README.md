guitar neck to draw notes and lines over >> Canvas-JS

Use dropdown to choose colour given to each semi-tone

Use color-button to either draw notes in these colours or a single colour of your choice

Use redraw-button to redraw all notes using the colour currently chosen, the original colours given to each semi-tone, or whatever colour the notes had when they were first clicked.

This way, and for the purposes of shape-excersices and such, you are not restricted to a colourful-only guitar neck, but can easily draw different patterns in the same colour, regardless of the notes in it, and change this colour to draw the next pattern.
